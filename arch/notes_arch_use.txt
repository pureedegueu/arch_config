#Upgrading the system regularly via pacman
#Upgrading packages prevents most signing errors.
#-S installs, y updates ur packages, u restrict update to out-to-date packages
#/!\ never use -Sy without u, risk of breaking ur system (unless ur in the second option, see below)
pacman -Syu

#If delay is unavoidable and system upgrade gets delayed for an extended period, manually 
#sync the package database and upgrade the archlinux-keyring package before system upgrade:
pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring && pacman -Su
